
These notes accompany the digital quantitative groundwater maps of Africa that are available to download from : 
https://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/groundwater/international/africanGroundwater/mapsDownload.html 

To display the Africa quantitative groundwater maps of Africa in ArcMap GIS:

Step 1:  Add the downloaded map file to ArcMap . Set Coordinate System to WGS 1984 if not already set.
Step 2:  Right-click on the ascii file within the Table of Contents and choose Display X Y Values:
	X: X
	Y: Y
	Set Geographic Coordinate System:  GCS_WGS_1984
An ascii events point layer is created

To save as Point Shapefile:
Step 3:  right-click on the ascii events point layer - Export - browse to the folder location and name/save as a shapefile

To convert to Raster:
Step 4: In Arc Tools:  choose Point to Raster and set the following:
	Input Features: the SCII Events Layer that you created in Step 2, above
	Value Field:  DTWAFRICA_ or GWSTOR_V2 or GWPROD_V2 (depending on which map - see Note, below)
	Output Raster Dataset:  name_me.img or .tif or .grid
	Cell Assignment Type:  most_frequent (default)
	Priority Field: none (default)
	Cellsize: 0.27 (default) (units = degrees. This produces a cell size equivalent to approximately 30 km on the ground. You can change this default cell size to a smaller one. The minimum appropriate cell size for this dataset is 0.05 degrees - this will produce a cell size equivalent to approximately 5 km on the ground. This is the maximum resolution of this dataset. Bear in mind that the smaller the cell size, the bigger the resulting file size will be).
	
To convert Raster to Polygon Shapefile:
Step 5: In Arc Tools:  choose Raster to Polygon and set the following:
	Input Raster: the img or .tif or .grid file that you created in Step 4, above.
	Field: DTWAFRICA_ or GWSTOR_V2 or GWPROD_V2 (See Note, below)
	Output Polygon Features: name_me.shp

Note:
If xyzASCII_gwstor_v1 - the Value Field to use is:  GWSTOR_V2
If xyzASCII_dtwmap_v2- the Value Field to use is: DTWAFRICA_
If xyzASCII_gwprod_v1 - the Value Field to use is: GWPROD_V2
